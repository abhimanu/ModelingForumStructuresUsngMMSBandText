\comment{Following are the experimemts that we are planning to do\\
1. Analyse and interpret the communties discovered on Wikipedia talk pages and
Cancer forum providing interesting insights and telling how modelling forum
structure helps. \\
2. Validate the above discovered communities either through held out likelihood
or perplexity. \\ 
3. Introduce a prediction task; there were several suggestions: \\
\hspace{3 cm} a) predict the topic of the posts by a user in a thread where for
training we have hand-labeled thread posts (suggested by Chong) \\
\hspace{3 cm} b) Hold out some users on some threads and predict whether the
user is going to post on the held-out threads \\}
