% Following are the experimemts that we are planning to do\\
% 1. Analyse and interpret the communties discovered on Wikipedia talk pages and
% Cancer forum providing interesting insights and telling how modelling forum
% structure helps. \\
% 2. Validate the above discovered communities either through held out likelihood
% or perplexity. \\ 
% 3. Introduce a prediction task; there were several suggestions: \\
% \hspace{3 cm} a) predict the topic of the posts by a user in a thread where for
% training we have hand-labeled thread posts (suggested by Chong) \\
% \hspace{3 cm} b) Hold out some users on some threads and predict whether the
% user is going to post on the held-out threads \\
% 3. Predicting the popularity of a response/post on Reddit as well as Stack
% Overflow. We can go much finer and predict whether a given user will upvote a
% post or not. We will also have to derive equations for this but shouldn't be
% too hard.
