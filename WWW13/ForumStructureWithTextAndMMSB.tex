\begin{abstract}

Online discussion forums are complex webs of overlapping subcommunities 
(macrolevel structure, across threads) in which users enact different roles 
depending on which subcommunity they are participating in within a particular 
time point (microlevel structure, within threads).  This sub-network structure 
is implicit in massive collections of threads. To uncover this implicit structure, 
we develop a scalable algorithm based on stochastic variational inference and 
levearge topic models (LDA) along with mixed membership stochastic block (MMSB) 
models. We evaluate our model on three large-scale datasets, Cancer-ThreadStarter (22K
users and 14.4K threads), Cancer-NameMention(15.1K users and 12.4K threads) and
StackOverFlow (1.19 million users and 4.55 million threads). Qualitatively, we
demonstrate that our model can provide useful explanations of microlevel
and macrolevel user presentation charcteristics in different communities
using the topics discovered from posts. Quantitatively, we show our model
does better than MMSB and LDA in predicting user reply structure within threads. 
% On another task of user survival prediction (evaluating factors that predict drop 
% off in participation), indicators extracted using our model increase the predictive 
% validity of previously published models.  
In addition, we demonstrate via synthetic 
data experiments that the proposed active sub-network discovery
model is stable and recovers the original parameters of the experimental
setup with high probability.
