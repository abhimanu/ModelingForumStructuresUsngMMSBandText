There have been flood of online forums in recent decade and consequently so havebeen the focus of academic research and industry on online social networks. Analysing online social networks and user forums have been approached usingvarious perspective such as graph/network based~\cite{Shi:2000:NCI:351581.351611,Shi00learningsegmentation} , probabilistic graphical model~\cite{ Airoldi:2008:MMS:1390681.1442798}, combined network \& text miningbased~\cite{Ho:2012:DHT:2187836.2187936,Nallapati:2008:JLT:1401890.1401957} approaches.But very few of the approaches have taken into the structural framework in which theconversation in online forums happen. This is important to correctly model theinteraction as well as the content posted by the users while interacting withthe user community. E.g. in an onlne forum there are topic-threads and userspost their responses on this thread after possibly reading trhough the responsesof other users in this thread. And the users possibly posts multiple times onthe thread in froms of replies to other posts in the thread. For analysingthe user interaction, besides taking into account the user interaction networkand the text posted, it becomes imperative that the structure of theconversation must also be taken into account. This will enable us to gaindeeper insights into user behavior in the online community. Very few researchwork has tried to bring the forum structure in the analysis of onlinecommunities.Our work here besides bringing network modeling and text mining together puts in the forum structure in the model to provide a more robust analysis ofthe user interactions. The current work also focuses on analysing large scale user interaction in bigonline social forums. We provide a variational approximation based estimationtechnique that is scalable to big forums with thousands of users.~\comment{Also write about stochastic approximation if given we have time and wecan get it working}
