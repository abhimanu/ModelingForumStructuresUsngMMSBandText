\comment{1) Currently our model just picks up one signal for the networkcomponent (MMSB part) i.e. in other words we are just modelling one type ofinteraction or just one graph, but as we did for the SEI model (tensor model) there are multiple types ofnetworks/graphs/interactions. Future work can incorporate this.\\2) Adding temporal dimension to this model would be a very interesting idea.E.g. how threads evolve over time, or how user behavior changes, or how newcommunities emerge in the forum etc.}
